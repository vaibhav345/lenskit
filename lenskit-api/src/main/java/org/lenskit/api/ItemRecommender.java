/**
 * Interface for recommending items. This interface provides APIs for both basic (recommend for a given user)
 * and complex (recommend at most *n* items from a given set to the user) recommendation tasks.
 *
 * The core idea of the recommend API is to recommend *n* items for a user,
 * where the items recommended are taken from a set of candidate items and
 * further constrained by an exclude set of forbidden items.
 *
 * ## Candidate Items
 *
 * By default, the candidate set is the universe of all items the recommender
 * knows about. The default exclude set is somewhat more subtle. Its exact
 * definition varies across implementations, but will be the set of items the
 * system believes the user will not be interested in by virtue of already
 * having or knowing about them. For example, rating-based recommenders will
 * exclude the items the user has rated, and purchase-based recommenders will
 * typically exclude items the user has purchased. Some implementations may
 * allow this to be configured. Client code always has the option of manually
 * specifying the exclude set, however, so applications with particular needs in
 * this respect can manually provide the sets they need respected.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * If the recommender has an opinion about the order in which recommendations should be displayed,
 * the result set will present items in that order.  For many recommenders, this will be descending order
 * by score; however, this interface does not guarantee a relationship between scores and ordering.

     * the candidate set, so the final effective candidate set is \\(\\mathcal{C} \\backslash \\mathcal{E}\\).
     *
     * The recommender is *not* guaranteed to return a full `n` recommendations.  There are many reasons
     * why it might return a shorter list, including lack of items, lack of coverage for items, or a
     * predefined notion of a maximum recommendation list length.  However, a negative value for `n` instructs
