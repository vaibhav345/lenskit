/**
 * Snapshot of the ratings data for building a recommender.
 *
 * This provides a snapshot of each user's most current rating for each item.  It may also represent synthetic ratings
 * derived from other types of events, depending on the builder that is used for it.
 *
 * The ratings obtained from a rating matrix **do not** have timestamps.
 *
 * The users, items, and ratings in the rating matrix are associated with 0-based indexes, so that they can be used
 * in conjunction with vectors or arrays.  The rating matrix can be thought of as a sparse matrix in coordinate list
 * (COO) format, and the index of the rating is its position in the coordinate list.
