# lenskit

## Name

*lenskit* - a command-line tool for LensKit

## Synopsis

**lenskit** [OPTIONS] *subcommand* [arguments]

## Description

The LensKit command line tool provides several capabilities for examining, evaluating, and using
LensKit recommender algorithms.  It primarily operates on LensKit algorithm configurations and
eval scripts written in the corresponding Groovy DSLs.

The various specific tools are exposed via subcommands, much like **git**(1) and similar tools.
The subcommands are listed below (see [Subcommands](#Subcommands)), and each is described in more
detail in its own manual page.

## Options

--help
:   Print usage instructions.

--log-file *FILE*
:   Write logging output to *FILE*.

--log-level *LEVEL*
:   Output log messages at level *LEVEL* (or higher).  Can be one of ‘TRACE’, ‘DEBUG’, ‘INFO’, ‘WARN’, or ‘ERROR’.
    The default is ‘INFO’.
    
--log-file-level *LEVEL*
:   Specify a different level for the log file (specified with `--log-file`).  If this option is not specified, then
    the log level set with `--log-level` is used for both the console and the log file.

--debug-grapht
:   Output INFO (or DEBUG, if **--debug** is also used) logging messages from Grapht.  Grapht is
    pretty noisy, so by default its output is filtered to warnigns and errors.  If you need to
    debug a problem that is occurring in Grapht, use this option.

## Subcommands

Each command is documented in its own man page, *lenskit-command*(1).

[version](man:lenskit-version(1))
:   Print the LensKit version.

[train-model](man:lenskit-train-model(1))
:   Train a recommender model and save it to disk.

[predict](man:lenskit-predict(1))
:   Predict user ratings for items, using a configuration or a trained model.

[recommend](man:lenskit-recommend(1))
:   Recommend items for users, using a configuration or a trained model.

[global-recommend](man:lenskit-global-recommend(1))
:   Recommend items with respect to a set of reference items.

[graph](man:lenskit-graph(1))
:   Output a GraphViz diagram of a recommender configuration (either from configuration files or a
    trained model).

## Environment and System Properties

The LensKit CLI (or its launcher script) recognize the following environment variables:

JAVA_OPTS
:   Additional flags to pass to the JVM (such as `-Xmx4g` to set the memory limit).

JAVA_HOME
:   Where to find the Java Runtime Environment.

Also, the following Java system properties can be set for useful effects:

logback.configurationFile
:   The location of a Logback configuration file.  This overrides all built-in or command line
    logging configuration (e.g. `--log-file`).
